        <p>Solution-Focused Ministry is a Christian leadership book about a new mindset - being Solution-Focused - and
          about the new methods that flow from this biblical way of looking at life, ministry, people and problems.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The first three chapters detail the solution-focused mindset, and the last five chapters will look at how to
          apply this mindset to your ministry.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Solution-Focused Ministry is designed for all those who are in Christian service (pastors, evangelists,
          teachers, non-profit leaders and missionaries), to give them a path out of "being stuck". It combines
          scriptural insight with deep practical application and exercises that will help you to construct your own
          unique path into the future.</p>
