        <em>
          What I love most about Solution-Focused Ministry is its unwavering commitment to bringing real solutions to
          real people, in real time. John challenges ministry leaders to shift their mindset from problem-focused to
          solution-focused, and he gives practical, actionable methods to make that shift a reality. This book is not
          theoreticalâ€”it's a hands-on guide for pastors, missionaries, and ministry leaders who are tired of spinning
          their wheels and ready to see God move in powerful new ways.<br><br>
          If you are a pastor or ministry leader who loves missions and desires to lead with greater clarity, impact,
          and Kingdom focus, I cannot recommend Solution-Focused Ministry enough. John Edmiston has written a guide that
          is biblically grounded, intensely practical, and deeply inspirational.

        John Edmiston has attributes rarely found in one lone individual. He possesses the spiritual fervor of a devoted
        pastor and missionary, the practical wisdom of a skilled management specialist, along with a penchant to serve
        the Lord on the frontiers of the latest technology.
      </p>

        As a true disciplemaker, John equips the reader to serve his or her congregation, ministry team, or community by
        helping them, too, have the "mental light bulb" pop on. Suddenly, there can be a team of people who see God's
        future instead of a lone and lonely visionary. Need encouragement? Need others to join you in trusting God for
        great things? This book is certainly a step in the right direction!
